<p>
COPT is a C++ based optimization open library. 
The very simple idea is to provide a complete computing library for basic optimization algorithms. 
It is powered by MathU organization in University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). 
The leaders are Zhouwang Yang, associated professor in USTC and Ruimin Wang, PhD candidate in USTC.

<p>
The library contains basic mathematical types like vector, matrix, function and solver. 
Matlab-like element access and assignment are allowed. 
It is quite simple to claim mathematical types after fixing basic traits.
